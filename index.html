        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        
        <p>My name is <b>Ali Hasan</b>.<br>
            I live in Imadpur which near Barsoi. I love reading <i>books</i> and want to read
            as much as I can during my lifetime.<br>
            Currently, I am learning to code with Kevin on <u>Khan Academy</u>.</P>

    <!-- Places-->
    <p> I also like visiting our crop fields which are a walk away from our home.<br>
        These days, paddy is being grown there. We have had very minimal rain this year and hence irrigation became the main concern for farmers at a time when oil prices<br>
        --with which they operate irrigation machines-- are at all time high.</p>
